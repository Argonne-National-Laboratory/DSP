--------

DSP is an open-source and parallel package that implements decomposition methods for **structured mixed-integer programming** problems. These are structured optimization problems in the following form:

        minimize   c^T x + \sum_{s=1}^S q_s^T y_s
        subject to   A x                              = b
                   T_s x +                    W_s y_s = h_s for s = 1, .., S
                   some x, y_s are integers

where x and y_s are decision variable vectors with dimensions n_1 and n_2, respectively, A, T_s and W_s are matrices of dimensions m_1 by n_1, m_2 by n_1 and m_2 by n_2, respectively, and c, q_s, b, and h_s are vectors of appropriate dimensions.

**DSP Solution Methods:**
* Extensive form solver (global solver)
* Serial/parallel dual decomposition (dual bounding solver)
* Serial/parallel Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (global solver)
* Serial/parallel Benders decomposition

**Problem Types:**
* Two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs
* Distributionally robust stochastic mixed-integer linear programs
* Structured mixed-integer linear programs

**Problem Input Formats:**
* SMPS file format for stochastic programs (`.dro` optionally for distributionally robust)
* MPS and DEC files for generic block-structured optimization problems
* Julia modeling package [DSPopt.jl](https://github.com/kibaekkim/DSPopt.jl)
