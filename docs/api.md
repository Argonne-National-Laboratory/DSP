# C API Functions

A number of C functions are exported and available for advanced users.
Please refer the header file `./src/DspCInterface.h`.

One may want to check out Julia package [DSPopt.jl](https://github.com/kibaekkim/DSPopt.jl) that implements the integerface to DSP by using these C API functions.
