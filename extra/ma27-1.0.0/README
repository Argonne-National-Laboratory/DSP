Installation
============

Compilation follows the standard process:
   ./configure
   make

To install the library, module and any header files into /usr/local you may
use the following command (this may require root permissions):
   make install

For further options, including installation in locations other than
/usr/local and specifying the use of particular Fortran compilers and
compile flags please run
   ./configure --help

External Libraries
==================

This package requires the following external libraries:


Example Programs
================

The example/ subdirectory contains example programs. These may be compiled
through the following command.
   make check

To successfully perform this check you will require the external libraries
detailed in the previous section. The configure script will attempt to find
these libraries, but you may need to explicitly specify their location.
