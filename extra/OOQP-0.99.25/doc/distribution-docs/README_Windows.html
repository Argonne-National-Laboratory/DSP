<p>README_Windows -- A installation guide for OOQP under Microsoft Windows</p>




This page is part of the <A HREF=../index.html> OOQP documentation </A>.

<h1 id="SYNOPSYS">SYNOPSYS</h1>

<p>OOQP was developed under an UNIX-like environment, but also may be installed and will run under Microsoft Windows. The C++ code itself is platform-independent. The only issue is the system for building the libraries and executables.</p>

<p>The file <a href="../distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a> contains instructions for compiling OOQP in a UNIX-like environment, as well as general information about installing OOQP. The current file contains suplemental information for compiling under Windows. You have two supported options. The first is to install and use Cygwin. The second is to compile under Microsoft Visual C++.</p>

<h1 id="CYGWIN">CYGWIN</h1>

<p>Cygwin is a UNIX-like environment that runs under Windows. It is freely available from http://www.cygwin.com, or may be purchased on machine readable media. If you choose to install Cygwin, you may simply follow the standard instructions in the <a href="../distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a> guide.</p>

<h1 id="Visual-C-">Visual C++</h1>

<p>The files needed to compile OOQP under Microsoft Visual Studio are not part of the standard OOQP distribution, but may be obtained from the OOQP web site http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp. Obtain the Visual Studio support files and extract them as instructed on the web page. You should now have a VisualStudio subdirectory within the OOQP directory.</p>

<p>You will also need to obtain the F2C translator and system libraries for Windows in order to compile MA27. See the <a href="../distribution-docs/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a> file for a discussion of the F2C and MA27 packages. Once you have obtained the F2C library, named vcf2c.lib, copy it to the lib subdirectory of the OOQP directory.</p>

<p>Once you have all the necessary files, open the OOQP\VisualStudio\OOQP.dsw workspace from within VisualStudio and build all the projects within it.</p>

<p>We were able to build OOQP on a Windows 2000 machine using Visual Studio v6.0.</p>
