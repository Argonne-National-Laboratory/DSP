NAME
    README_Windows -- A installation guide for OOQP under Microsoft Windows

SYNOPSYS
    OOQP was developed under an UNIX-like environment, but also may be
    installed and will run under Microsoft Windows. The C++ code itself is
    platform-independent. The only issue is the system for building the
    libraries and executables.

    The file INSTALL contains instructions for compiling OOQP in a UNIX-like
    environment, as well as general information about installing OOQP. The
    current file contains suplemental information for compiling under
    Windows. You have two supported options. The first is to install and use
    Cygwin. The second is to compile under Microsoft Visual C++.

CYGWIN
    Cygwin is a UNIX-like environment that runs under Windows. It is freely
    available from http://www.cygwin.com, or may be purchased on machine
    readable media. If you choose to install Cygwin, you may simply follow
    the standard instructions in the INSTALL guide.

Visual C++
    The files needed to compile OOQP under Microsoft Visual Studio are not
    part of the standard OOQP distribution, but may be obtained from the
    OOQP web site http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp. Obtain the Visual
    Studio support files and extract them as instructed on the web page. You
    should now have a VisualStudio subdirectory within the OOQP directory.

    You will also need to obtain the F2C translator and system libraries for
    Windows in order to compile MA27. See the INSTALL file for a discussion
    of the F2C and MA27 packages. Once you have obtained the F2C library,
    named vcf2c.lib, copy it to the lib subdirectory of the OOQP directory.

    Once you have all the necessary files, open the
    OOQP\VisualStudio\OOQP.dsw workspace from within VisualStudio and build
    all the projects within it.

    We were able to build OOQP on a Windows 2000 machine using Visual Studio
    v6.0.
