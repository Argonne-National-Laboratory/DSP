Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.25 (August 30, 2014)

- Throw an exception if MA27 cannot factor a matrix.  Previously,
  OOQP would crash in this situation.

- Have svm-gondzio.exe accept either --print_solution or --print-solution.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.24 (October 15, 2012)

- Initialize an array used by MA57 to zero, to prevent MA57 from using
  uninitialized memory. (Thanks to John Grove for pointing this out.)

- Update INSTALL instructions for MA57 and indicate that the MA27
  interface is the best supported and most robust.

- Initialize a formerly uninitialized field in MpsReader

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.23 (August 12, 2012)

- Modernize installation scripts and documentation.
- Update the AMPL interface.
- Honor the "maximize" flag in the AMPL interface (previously ignored)
- Update the C++ dialect to match modern compilers.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.22 (March 9, 2008)

Changed scaling of linear term in the formulation of the SVM problem
by a factor of 2.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.19 (March 2007)

Fixed a bug in OOQP/src/Mex/ooqp.m.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.16 (March 2006)
- Fixed bugs in OOQP/src/Readers/MpsReader.C and MpsReader.h related
  to the usage of function string_copy.

- Made changes to MpsReader.C to allow the first field (label) of
  BOUNDS and RHS rows to be optional.

- Updated the PETSc interface to the PETSc 2.3 API. (Thanks to Quan
  Nguyen for his help with this!)

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.12 (June 2005)
- Examples in the OOQP/examples/QpGen/cinterface folder
  (e.g. dense_example.c and example.c) have been modified to include
  an equality constraint. The file Example.qps in the
  OOQP/examples/QpGen/sample-qps (the input data to mps.c from the
  OOQP/examples/QpGen/cinterface folder) has also been modified to
  include the equality constraint.
- An example using the Harwell Boeing format is included in
  hb_example.c in the OOQP/examples/QpGen/cinterface folder.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.11 (May 2005)
- In accordance with the ANSI C++ standards, standard header files
  have been included without the extension .h - for example iostream.h
  is now iostream, and since all classes and functions defined in
  standard libraries are under the std namespace, using namespace std
  has been used in conjunction with iostream.
- Header files that come from the C language have been prefixed with
  the character c - for example stdio.h is now included as cstdio.  
- User defined header files have been left unchanged.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.10 (May 2004)
- A new option --scale has been added to the existing command-line
  arguments. This allows the solution of problems in which variables
  or equations have a vast range of values. This work was motivated by
  some practical problems arising in forestry management, in which the
  values of some data objects ranged over 25 orders of magnitude. New
  methods to scale the data have been added to QpGenData.c and the
  column scale, row scale and symmetric scale methods have been added
  to sparseSymMatrix.C, sparseGenMatrix.C, denseSymMatrix.C,
  denseGenMatrix.C.

- The input file reader (MpsReader.C) has been modified to allow a
  more flexible format than the standard QPS definition. The changes
  are as follows: 

    - Code related to column-specific parsing (as defined by QPS
      standards) has been removed and instead, new code that tokenizes
      each line using space delimiters has been added. This flexible
      input format allows for the presence of additional spaces
      between fields.

     - Name records have been expanded from 8 to 16 characters in
       length and numbers no longer have a maximum length of 12
       characters. The current version of OOQP allows for a maximum of
       150 (previously 61) characters per input line to account for
       the increase in length of names, numbers and additional spaces.

     - An additional section for objective sense (MAX or MIN) has been
       allowed at the beginning of the file. If this section is not
       provided, it is assumed that the problem is a minimization. An
       example of indicator and data record for this section is
       provided. If used, the additional section should appear in
       order as the first section after the NAME section:

         NAME example.qps
         OBJSENSE 
         MAX

       The current version of the reader allows the user to define an
       optional QMATRIX section (each line of which corresponds to one
       nonzero coefficient of the matrix Q) following the BOUNDS
       section.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.09
- ooqp-ampl prints the objective value
- The CInterface routines have been changed to return the objective
  value.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.08

- Retired the storage.C and storage.h files because the functionality
  in these files is better handled by instances of SimpleVector and
  DenseStorage.
- Updated the Petsc interface to work with either Petsc version 2.1.0 or 2.1.1.
- Version information is now available to the code in
  OoqpVersion.[Ch]. The qpgen executables now print the version.
- Configure works properly with f2c, and instructions on using f2c
  were added to the install files.
-Introduction of a Windows port

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.07

- Introduction of the StartStrategy classes that allow programmers to
  set the starting point.
- Introduction of ooqp-start to allow users to experiment with
  starting points within matlab.
- Introduction of the print-level option in ampl the ampl interface.

Major Changes in OOQP 0.99.06

- Updated the interface to MA27 to use the new MA27 interface.
- Added a test to configure.in to make sure the old MA27 libraries are
  not being used.
- Added a NEWS file ;-)
