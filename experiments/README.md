# How to Generate the Numerical Results

This describes the steps to generate the numerical results reported in the numerical results section in our recent paper.

1. Clone the source code by
```bash
git clone -b BB-v0.0.1 --recursive https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/DSP.git DSP-BB
```
2. Check the prerequisites in `PREREQUISITES.md` (contained in the source code or on the repository). To run in parallel, `MPI` is necessary to install. In particular, the script `runs.sh` in this directory has been written for using `MPI`.
3. Follow the installation steps in `INSTALL.md` (contained in the source code or on the repository). Since all the results will be generated by running binary file `runDsp`, we do not need to care about the shared object or setting the library path.
4. Please take a look at `runs.sh`, which is the bash script for running all the problem instances used in the paper with different parameter files to set options for branching methods and the simple heuristic. One can run this script, or one may edit the script for their computing environment. The solutions will be written in `solns` directory. The first two lines of each solution file report the best primal and dual bounds of the instance.
