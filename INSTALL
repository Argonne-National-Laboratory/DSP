NAME
    INSTALL -- An installation guide for DSP.

THE BOTTOM LINE
    If you have all the prerequisite packages installed on your system (see
    the "BUILD ESSENTIALS" and "PREREQUISITES" sections below), then you need
    to go to the root directory of DSP and type

        cmake .

    to configure OOQP. If you wish to install the package in a more permanent
    location, you may then type

        make install

    External packages (MA27, OOQP, SCIP Optimization Suite, Smi) used in DSP 
    are built automatically. A shared object is installed in ./lib directory.
    Once the installation has been successfully done, you need to set an
    environment variable DSP_INC and (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    For Linux,

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<DSP source path>/lib
        export DSP_INC=<DSP source path>/julia

    For Mac,

        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:<DSP source path>/lib
        export DSP_INC=<DSP source path>/julia

BUILD ESSENTIALS
    The following packages are essential to build DSP and the required external
    software packages. If you do not have any of the following packages, and if
    you do not know how to get it, please see the "HOW TO GET BUILD ESSENTIALS"
    section below.

        Mac Ports
        CMake
        GNU Autoconf
        GNU Automake
        GNU Make
        MPICH
        BLAS
        LAPACK
        SVN

PREREQUISITES
    The following packages need to be installed on your system and located on 
    ./extra directory before DSP may be built.

  MA27 (./extra/ma27-1.0.0)
    MA27 is a library for solving sparse symmetric indefinite linear systems. 
    To build OOQP solver, you must have this installed. This is part of HSL
    (formerly the Harwell Subroutine Library), a collection of ISO Fortran 
    codes for large scale scientific computation.

    You can download the source files and obtain the free personal license from

        http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/hslarchive.html

    Move the downloaded directory to 

        ./extras/ma27-1.0.0/

  OOQP (./extra/OOQP-0.99.25)
    OOQP is an object-oriented C++ package, based on a primal-dual interior-point
    method, for solving convex quadratic programming problems. You can get the
    source code per request to the developer.

        http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp/

  SCIP Optimization Suite (./extra/scipoptsuite-3.1.1)
    SCIP is non-commercial solvers for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed
    integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). It is freely available from the website.

        http://scip.zib.de/download.php?fname=scipoptsuite-3.1.1.tgz

JULIA
    Julia is a high level dynamic programming language for technical computing, with
    syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments such
    as MATLAB and Python. This is an optional package for DSP. However, DSP provides
    an interface to an algebraic modeling package StochJuMP based on Julia. The
    interface package can be installed by the Julia command

        Pkg.clone("https://github.com/kibaekkim/DSP.jl.git");

    and the examples are located at

        ./examples/julia

    We storongly encourage DSP users to try this. Julia can be downloaded from

        http://julialang.org/downloads/

HOW TO GET BUILD ESSENTIALS
    The following packages are essential to build DSP and the required external
    software packages.

  Mac Ports
    This may be requires on Mac only. This is a Mac version of the package 
    manager that downloads, compiles, and installs open-source software 
    packages. You can get it from

        https://www.macports.org/install.php

    You Mac will need this if you do not have GNU compilers, a version of 
    MPICH, or SVN.

  CMake
    This is used to control the software compilation process using simple
    platform and compiler independent configuration files. You can obtain a 
    version of this by the following.
    On Ubuntu,

        sudo apt-get install cmake

    On Mac,

        sudo port install cmake

    For more information refer to

        http://www.cmake.org

  GNU Autoconf
    Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts 
    to automatically configure software source code packages. This is used
    to configure and compile external software packages. You may already have
    a version installed. Otherwise, you can obtain by the following.
    On Ubuntu,

        sudo apt-get install autoconf

    On Mac,

        sudo port install autoconf

    For more information refer to

        http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  GNU Automake
    Automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files compliant
    with the GNU Coding Standards. This is used to configure and compile external 
    software packages. You may already have a version installed. Otherwise, you
    can obtain by the following.
    On Ubuntu,

        sudo apt-get install automake

    On Mac,

        sudo port install automake

    For more information refer to

        http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

  GNU Make
    GNU Make is a free tool that generates executables and other non-source 
    files of a program from the source files. You may already have a version 
    of make installed. If not, you can easily get it installed by the following.
    On Ubuntu,

        sudo apt-get install build-essential
        sudo apt-get install xutils-dev

    On Mac,

        sudo port selfupdate
        sudo port install gcc49

    To use GNU compilers by default on your Mac, you need to activate by

        sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc49

  MPICH
    This is a portable implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) 
    standard. You can get a version of MPICH by the following.
    On Ubuntu,

        sudo apt-get install libmpich-dev

    On Mac,

        sudo port selfupdate
        sudo port install mpich-gcc49

  BLAS
    BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard 
    building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. You may 
    already have a version of BLAS installed on your machine. If not, you can 
    obtain and install it on Ubuntu,

        sudo apt-get install libblas-dev

    Mac provides an optimized version of BLAS in a framework Accelerate. This
    will be detected and automatically added to the link flag by CMake.

    For more information refer to

        http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html

  LAPACK
    LAPACK is a freely-available software package to provide routines or solving
    systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear 
    systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. You 
    may already have a version of BLAS installed on your machine. If not, you can 
    obtain and install it on Ubuntu,

        sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev

    Mac provides an optimized version of BLAS in a framework Accelerate. This
    will be detected and automatically added to the link flag by CMake.

    For more information refer to

        http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html

  SVN
    This is used to download an external package SMI from the Coin-OR repository.
    Mac may already have a version of this installed. Otherwise, you can get it

        sudo port install subversion

    Similarly, Ubuntu can get it from

        sudo apt-get install subversion
